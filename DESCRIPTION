Description: Fit calibrations curves for clinical prediction models and calculate several associated metrics (Eavg, E50, E90, Emax). Ideally predicted probabilities from a prediction model should align with observed probabilities. Calibration curves relate predicted probabilities (or logit(probability)) to observed outcomes via a flexible non-linear smoothing function. `pmcalibration` allows users to choose between several smoothers (regression splines, GAMs, lowess, loess).
    Currently only binary outcomes are supported but we aim to expand functionality (e.g., include time-to-event).
