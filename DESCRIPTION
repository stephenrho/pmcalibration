Description: Fit calibrations curves for clinical prediction models and calculate several associated 
  metrics (Eavg, E50, E90, Emax). Ideally predicted probabilities from a prediction model 
  should align with observed probabilities. Calibration curves relate predicted probabilities 
  (or a transformation thereof) to observed outcomes via a flexible non-linear smoothing function. 
  'pmcalibration' allows users to choose between several smoothers (regression splines, generalized 
  additive models/GAMs, lowess, loess). Both binary and time-to-event outcomes are supported.
