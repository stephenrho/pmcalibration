\title{pmcalibration: Calibration Curves For Clinical Prediction Models}
\description{
Fit calibrations curves for clinical prediction models and calculate several associated metrics (Eavg, E50, E90, Emax). Ideally predicted probabilities from a prediction model should align with observed probabilities. Calibration curves relate predicted probabilities (or a transformation thereof) to observed outcomes via a flexible non-linear smoothing function. `pmcalibration` allows users to choose between several smoothers (regression splines, GAMs, lowess, loess). Both binary and time-to-event outcomes are supported.
